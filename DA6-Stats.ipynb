Each subject completed the circuit at two different points in time, one week apart, producing two trials, A and B. During the week between trials, subjects received therapy services to improve their ability to perform the circuit. Using this circuit dataset, is the mean circuit duration for subjects at trial B less than it was at trial A (meaning, did the subjects perform the circuit faster after one week of physical therapy)?\n",

    "1. A false positive occurs when a classification algorithm labels an instance as \"positive\" when its actually \"negative.\" A false negative occurs when a classification algorithm labels an instance as \"negative\" when its actually \"positive.\" In the case of the Amazon recruiting tool, an example of a false negative would be a \"5-star\" female candidate being labeled by the algorithm as a \"1-star.\" Assuming no perfectly accurate recruiting algorithm exists yet (e.g. one that only classifies true positives and true negatives), a company that uses such an algorithm is trying to spend less time/money on human recruiters/hiring managers at the expense of accuracy/fairness. At what balance is this trade-off worth it? Is this time supposedly saved by hiring managers time spent elsewhere?\n",
    "1. The article states that job candidates are not likely to know that an automatic screening tool reviewed their resume, or to hear back about what their rating is and why. The latter part of this statement was also the case prior to the age of automation, where you could apply for a job and also never hear back about your evaluation. What (if anything) is different about being denied an opportunity to advance based on an algorithmic decision versus a human decision? Aren't they both biased? \n",
    "1. Language is constantly evolving and the meaning of a single word/phrase is both dynamic and dependent on context. The article describes how \"masculine language\", like the verbs \"executed\" and \"captured\", was favored by the machine learning algorithm. You can imagine an attribute/feature used in the historical dataset like a boolean `contains_action_verbs` or a float `action_verb_score`. Since we know a feedback loop to update/improve a model is super important from our readings in Weapons of Math Destruction, could this model's preference for masculine language be improved? Is it worth improving?\n",
